// flowConn sits between a TLS/REALITY connection and the local HTTP/2 stack.
// It rewrites HTTP/2 flow control so that nothing buffers more than its reader
// has recently shown it can consume, the way TCP autotuning does:
//   - uplink: the client is shown a small initial window and gets credit only
//     as the handler reads, capped at twice what the handler read per RTT;
//   - downlink: the server is shown a small client window and gets the
//     client's credit back only while unread data at the client stays under
//     twice what the client read per RTT.
// On a server both apply; on a client only the downlink does, since that is
// the only side of the exchange whose buffers are local. Neither peer needs to
// know: each only ever sees a window no larger than the other side granted.
